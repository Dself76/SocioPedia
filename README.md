Basic social media site I am working. Html, Css, Javascritp and python with Flask. Saves user data and posts to a SQL Data base..
Have not been working on this. I was focusing too much on front end. I have been trying to focus on Databases, Machine Learning, NLP, scraping and more Java. will Update this still just had to take a break from it. it is very
basic i was initially just trying to get used to basic Flask and connecting a data base.
